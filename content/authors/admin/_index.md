Ray is a D.Eng Student at the Academy for Engineering and Technology at Fudan University. He worked in Robot Manipulation Lab for one year. Date to January 2019, Itâ€™s the first time he touched the robot on MoveItDay China. After short-term learning to manipulate a 6-DOF robot arm. He learned that he still has a long way to go. On later October, he took part in  ROScon2019 at Macau, the stories about researchers and developers inspired him to move forward. Even now he struggled with his work and research, he still remembers conversations with his friends Lentin and Archu, which means a lot to him.
