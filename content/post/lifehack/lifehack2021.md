–	#productivity-boost #life-hack 就像我昨天空闲时间很多，会过度思考在其他方面的事情，一方面这些事情确实有潜在的作用，另一方面，反映了我在计划时不够明确。 2021-04-18

–	#life-hack If you have little money and you want to be rich, you must first be focused, not balanced. If you look at any successful person, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress walking 如果你的资金很少而又想致富，你必须首先集中于一点，而不是追求平衡。那些成功的投资这，在最初肯定不是追求平衡，追求平衡只会在原地踏步。要进步，你必须先做到不平衡，并注意怎样才能使得自己不断进步。 Robert T. Kiyosaki Poor dad and Rich dad

–	#life-hack #productivity-boost What's a strange thing that happened to me. I do not care about the time, even waste time during the day, such as do not wake up on time, or sometimes I am late for the schedule, I will procrastinate for the later time. However, during the nighttime, for example, 8 pm now, I will complain that the time is little. As if this situation is the [[rabbit hole]]. Over and over again. w.r.t [[How to write a SMART goal]]
•	I will refer this situation has some environmental triggers:
–	I am alone in the dorm with low motivation.
–	attened the experiment with iphone, and withouth any other specific tasks.
–	missing someone when I wake up. such as bring someone in my mind, like Yijia Su.

–	#life-hack When I fell pain, it's the time to learn from it!
•	[[Ray Dalio]] If you don't let up on yourself and instead become comfortable always operating with some level of pain, you will evolve at a faster pace! 
–	当我感到疼痛的时候，我放过自己，选择不健康舒适的方式，我一直处于这个痛苦的循环中，下次，下下次，它还回来！
•	[[Ray Dalio]] Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life - you have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion. 每当你面对痛苦的事情时，你都处于人生中一个潜在的重要关头! 你可以选择 健康但是痛苦 的真相，或者 不健康但是舒服 的幻觉！
•	The pain is the signal! Like switching from not exercising to exercising, developing the habit of embracing the pain and learning from it will "get you to the other side." 痛苦是一个信号！就像从不锻炼->锻炼，培养拥抱痛苦的习惯，从中学习 "会让你到达另一边！"

–	#life-hack #book-reading 人生苦难重重，人们总是有逃避问题的倾向，^^绝大多数人的心理都存在缺陷^^。
•	有些人逃避现实世界，不惜躲到自己虚拟的世界里面（或者裹上一层又一层华丽的茧）
